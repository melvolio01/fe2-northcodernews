NorthCoders News (Front End)

A single-page application built using React (with React Router for routes) and the brilliant create-react-app configuration tool. Hosted by netlify at: https://5ba7a53d73f2cf5e73bc3bb7.happy-lamarr-657b75.netlify.com/topics/football

This application consumes the NC News API hosted on heroku at: 
https://mighty-refuge-69006.herokuapp.com/api/

NorthCoder News is a reddit-style site featuring articles on a range of subjects (coding, football and cooking). The articles can be sorted/filtered on date of publication and on 'popularity' (an aggregate of vote-count and comments left on the article). 

Comments can be left/deleted on each article by the user (who can also up and down-vote articles/comments). Comments can also be filtered (in much the same way as articles).

No CSS frameworks were harmed in the making of this site. Styling is with CSS-grid/flex-box and media-queries for smaller screens.

Installation

The site can be cloned as follows:

git clone https://github.com/melvolio01/fe2-northcodernews.git

cd fe2-northcodernews

npm start

Then go the directed path, eg localhost:3000, in your browser.
